Tracking your mental health can be difficult. Understanding your mood helps you manage your emotions, energy and feel better. This app allows the user to create a Journal that tracks their mood, energy and sleep to monitor, gain introspection and to share with a licensed professional.
If you are more aware of your mental health, you may be able to better manage your lifestyle, make informed decisions, prevent or avoid triggers, and work towards a better quality of life.


I have attached a power point that shares an overview of the project.

<h1>Installation</h1>

<p>Open integrated terminals for the "api" and "ui" folders.

In each terminal, run npm install to install dependencies.

Make sure you have an instance of Docker running.

Create a database named Namaste_db.

In the "api" intergrated terminal, run npx knex migrate:latest and npx knex seed:run to create and seed tables.</p>

<h1>Starting the app</h1>

Using both intergrated terminals, run npm start to start the app!

This should automatically open your browser with the link http://localhost:3000 to access the app.

To start, create an account! Click the login button on the navbar. In this page, it has a link "create an account" which will take you to the register page to create an account!
