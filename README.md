Tracking your mental health can be difficult. Understanding your mood helps you manage your emotions, energy and feel better. This app allows the user to create a Journal that tracks their mood, energy and sleep to monitor, gain introspection and to share with a licensed professional.
If you are more aware of your mental health, you may be able to better manage your lifestyle, make informed decisions, prevent or avoid triggers, and work towards a better quality of life.


I have attached a power point that shares an overview of the project.
